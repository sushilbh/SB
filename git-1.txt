//How do I reset the git master branch to the upstream branch in a forked repository?
git checkout master
// this will delete all your local changes to master
git reset --hard upstream/master
// take care, this will delete all your changes on your forked master
git push origin master --force

//Delete remote branch

git push <remote_name url of your forked repo> --delete <branch_name>


//this command will undo your last edited file)
git checkout docker/jenkins/filename

//push modified file to remote repo

 git checkout -b Branchname (This will create and checkout to your new branch)
 git commit -m"commit message" //modified file path such as jenkins/docker/plugins.txt
 git push origin //branch name

//Send a pull request on GitHub for only latest commit
//you might need these before the checkout/cherry-pick commands
git remote add upstream <git repository>
git remote update
git checkout -b <new-branch-name> upstream/master

git cherry-pick <SHA hash of commit>

git push origin <new-branch-name>
