 git rebase -i master

#Make sure your branch is up to date with the master branch.
#Run git rebase -i master.
#You should see a list of commits, each commit starting with the word "pick".
#Make sure the first commit says "pick" and change the rest from "pick" to "squash". -- This will squash each commit into the previous commit, which will continue until every commit is squashed into the first commit.
#Save and close the editor.
#It will give you the opportunity to change the commit message.
#Save and close the editor again.
#Then you have to force push the final, squashed commit: git push -f.
